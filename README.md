N Queen 

N-Queens Problem Solver using Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing

This project implements two algorithms, Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing, to solve the classic N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem asks how to place N queens on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other (i.e., no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).

Project Features:

The user can specify the size of the chessboard (N).
The user can select the search algorithm to use (Hill Climbing or Simulated Annealing).
The program displays the initial and final board configurations, as well as the number of iterations and the final score (number of attacking pairs).
The program allows for visualization of the search process (optional).
Implementation Details:

The program is written in Java.
